# Savvy-Designs

## Description
Built as a template website using PHP, made to move quickly in between pages and loads quickly. Site content is dynamic based on a MySql data on the backend supplying images. It is designed to have an admin page added with authentication to allow users to modify content that is displayed (This feature is currently under construction). When data base isnâ€™t connected, the website has default elements allowing the site not to break.
